# Description
The app displays a simple form with 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'message' fields.\
Form has a basic validation and displays errors for invalid data.\
After submitting correct values the application stores them in a Redux based store and displays them on the screen. In case of saving invalid values errors are displayed.\
When saved values are displaying user can clear them to see the form again.
